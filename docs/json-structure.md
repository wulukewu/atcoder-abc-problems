# AtCoder Statistics JSON Data Structures

This document describes the JSON files generated by the AtCoder Statistics script and stored in the `web-page/json/` directory.

## 1. `statics.json`

This is the main data structure that organizes all contest problems by their contest type.

```json
{
  "abc": {                           // AtCoder Beginner Contest problems
    "abc123": {                      // Contest ID
      "problem_id_123_A": {          // Problem ID
        "problem_index": "A",        // Problem index within contest (A, B, C, etc.)
        "difficulty": 800,           // Difficulty rating (integer)
        "point": 100,                // Point value for the problem
        "color": "brown"             // Color category based on difficulty
      },
      // More problems in this contest...
    },
    // More ABC contests...
  },
  "arc": { /* ... */ },  // AtCoder Regular Contest problems (same structure as abc)
  "agc": { /* ... */ },  // AtCoder Grand Contest problems (same structure as abc)
  "other": { /* ... */ } // Other contest problems (same structure as abc)
